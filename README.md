## üöÄÔ∏è Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a running node. 

*Prerequisites:*
- configuration file for a needed network from [here](https://plixcoin.io)

Linux systems:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
java -jar node/target/plix-all*.jar path/to/config/plix-{network}.conf
```

Mac systems (assuming already installed homebrew):
```bash
brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
java -jar node/target/plix-all*.jar path/to/config/plix-{network}.conf
```




> More details on how to install a node for different platforms you can [find in the documentation](https://plixcoin.io). 

## üîß Configuration

The best starting point to understand available configuration parameters is the [this article](https://plixcoin.io).

The easiest way to start playing around with configurations is to use default configuration files for different networks, they're available [here](./node).

Logging configuration with all available levels and parameters is described [here](https://plixcoin.io).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

The node can be built and installed wherever Java can run. 
To build and test this project, you will have to follow these steps:

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

*1. Setup the environment.*
- Install Java for your platform:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre                     # Ubuntu
# or
# brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8 # Mac
```

- Install SBT (Scala Build Tool)

Please follow the SBT installation instructions depending on your platform ([Linux](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html), [Mac](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html), [Windows](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html))

*2. Clone this repo*

```bash

cd PLIX
```

*3. Compile and run tests*

```bash
sbt checkPR
```

*4. Run integration tests (optional)*

Create a Docker image before you run any test: 
```bash
sbt node-it/docker
```

- Run all tests. You can increase or decrease number of parallel running tests by changing `plix.it.max-parallel-suites`
system property:
```bash
sbt -Dwaves.it.max-parallel-suites=1 node-it/test
```

- Run one test:
```bash
sbt node-it/testOnly *.TestClassName
# or 
# bash node-it/testOnly full.package.TestClassName
```

*5. Build packages* 

```bash
sbt packageAll                   # Mainnet
sbt -Dnetwork=testnet packageAll # Testnet
```

`sbt packageAll` ‚Äåproduces only `deb` package along with a fat `jar`. 

*6. Install DEB package*

`deb` package is located in target folder. You can replace '*' with actual package name:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i node/target/*.deb
```


*7. Run an extension project locally during development (optional)*

```bash
sbt "extension-module/run /path/to/configuration"
```

*8. Configure IntelliJ IDEA (optional)*

The majority of contributors to this project use IntelliJ IDEA for development, if you want to use it as well please follow these steps:

1. Click on `Add configuration` (or `Edit configurations...`)
2. Click on `+` to add a new configuration, choose `Application`
3. Specify:
   - Main class: `com.plixplatform.Application`
   - Program arguments: `/path/to/configuration`
   - Use classpath of module: `extension-module`
4. Click on `OK`
5. Run this configuration
